# Zero Hunger

## Overview

An NGO dedicated to feeding deprived people and children. A significant amount of food is wasted daily in events such as office programs and restaurants. Zero Hunger is to make use of this surplus food by collecting it from restaurants before it gets spoiled and distributing it to those in need.

## Workflow

1. **Collection Request Creation by Restaurants**
   - Restaurants can open a collection request from their dashboard.
   - They must specify the maximum time they can preserve the food before it needs to be collected.

2. **Request Acceptance and Employee Assignment**
   - Our system will receive the collection request.
   - An employee will be assigned to collect the food.

3. **Food Collection and Distribution**
   - The assigned employee will collect the food from the restaurant.
   - The food will be distributed by our employee to the deprived people and children.
   - Upon completion, the collection request will be marked as completed.

4. **Tracking**
   - The system will track all collection requests and their details, including the status and history of each request.
